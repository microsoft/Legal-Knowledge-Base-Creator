# Refresh Orchestrator — KB Creation Framework
# Version: 1.0 | Created: 2026-04-09
# Scope: Manages ongoing maintenance, staleness detection, and breaking development surfacing.
# Dependencies: Reads 01-shared-axioms.md. Invokes 04-fact-checker for verification of updates.
# Independence: Operates continuously on a schedule. Does not require a human trigger per cycle.
# Key output: Development log with significance tiers for downstream memo/alert generation.

## PURPOSE

This module keeps the KB portfolio current after initial build. It handles:

- Scheduled and event-triggered refresh cycles
- Staleness detection by field volatility
- Content updates (corrections, additions, structural changes)
- A **development log** that classifies changes by significance
- **Breaking news surfacing** — pushing high-significance developments to a queue for human action
- Coordination with the Fact-Checker for post-update verification

It does NOT build KBs from scratch (that's the Builder). It does NOT draft memos or alerts (that's the user's downstream workflow — Virtual David, email drafting, etc.). It surfaces the raw material that makes those outputs possible.

## SECTION 1: REFRESH CADENCE

### Default Schedule

| KB Type | Refresh Interval | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Legal topic KBs | 30 days | Regulatory landscape shifts monthly; court filings weekly |
| Company KBs | 60 days | Quarterly earnings cycle; litigation updates less frequent |
| Litigation KBs | 14 days | Active cases have frequent docket activity |
| Person KBs | 90 days | Positions evolve slowly unless triggered by events |

### Event Triggers (Override Schedule)

Any of these events triggers an immediate refresh cycle for the affected KB(s):

| Trigger | Example | Affected KBs |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Major court ruling | Supreme Court SEP decision | SEPs KB, all company KBs with SEP exposure |
| Regulatory action | EU DMA fine issued | Company KB (target), Competition KB, relevant topic KBs |
| M&A announcement | Company acquisition | Both company KBs, relevant topic KBs |
| Legislation enacted | New AI safety law signed | AI Governance KB, affected company KBs |
| Standards body decision | New patent policy adopted | IP/Patents KB, affected company KBs |
| Company earnings release | Quarterly report | That company's KB |
| User request | "Update the Qualcomm KB" | Specified KB |

### Trigger Detection

The Refresh Orchestrator does NOT passively monitor news feeds. It is invoked either:
1. On schedule (by the user or an automation)
2. On demand (user flags an event)
3. By the Audit System (when cross-KB analysis reveals staleness patterns)

## SECTION 2: REFRESH CYCLE PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Staleness Scan

For each file in the KB:
1. Read the file's `last_updated` metadata
2. Check the file's content against the High-Volatility Fields Checklist (Shared Axioms Section 4):
   - Financial data older than 1 quarter → STALE
   - Litigation status not matching current docket → STALE
   - Regulatory filing status not current → STALE
   - Leadership/executive roles not current → STALE
   - Market share/rankings older than 6 months → STALE
3. Web search for developments since `last_updated` in each topic area
4. Produce a **staleness report** listing:
   - Files needing updates (with specific stale claims)
   - New developments not yet covered
   - Structural changes needed (new sections, file splits)

### Step 2: Content Update

For each stale file:
1. Web search for current, verified information
2. Replace stale content with updated content
3. Add new developments not previously covered
4. Preserve all existing content that remains accurate — don't rewrite what isn't broken
5. Update `last_updated` metadata
6. Update index.md and table-of-authorities.md if sources changed

### Step 3: Verification

Invoke the Fact-Checker in **Refresh Verification mode** (Mode 3 from 04-fact-checker.md):
- Verify only the CHANGED content (not the entire KB)
- Apply corrections
- Log results in verification_log.md

### Step 4: Development Log Entry

Log every change with a significance tier (see Section 3).

### Step 5: Update Summary

Produce `sources/refresh_[date].md`:

```markdown
# Refresh Summary — [KB Name]
# Date: [date]
# Trigger: [scheduled / event: description]

## Files Updated
| File | Changes | Significance |
|------|---------|-------------|
| [filename] | [brief description] | [Routine/Notable/Breaking] |

## New Developments Added
| Development | File | Significance |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| [description] | [where added] | [tier] |

## Stale Content Corrected
| Claim | Was | Now | Source |
|-------|-----|-----|--------|
| [old claim] | [old value] | [new value] | [source URL] |

## Verification Results
- Claims verified: [N]
- Confirmed: [N]
- Corrected: [N]
- Verification rate: [%]

## Breaking Developments (if any)
[Detailed description of any Breaking-tier items — these feed the development queue]
```

---

## SECTION 3: DEVELOPMENT LOG

### Purpose

The development log is the Refresh Orchestrator's primary value-add beyond simple maintenance. It transforms raw content updates into structured, classified intelligence that can drive downstream legal work.

### Log Location

`sources/development_log.md` — append-only, per KB.

### Entry Format

```markdown
## [Date] — [Significance Tier]

**Development:** [One-line summary]
**Details:** [2-5 sentences explaining what happened and why it matters]
**Source:** [URL or citation]
**KB Impact:** [Which files were updated]
**Downstream potential:** [What kind of memo/alert this could feed]

---
```

### Significance Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Action | Examples |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Routine** | Expected updates, minor corrections, data refreshes | Log only. No escalation. | Q4 revenue updated, executive title change, new patent filed |
| **Notable** | Meaningful developments that shift the landscape but don't require immediate action | Log + flag in refresh summary for user review at next session | New litigation filed, regulatory investigation opened, major policy shift announced |
| **Breaking** | Developments requiring potential immediate client communication, legal strategy adjustment, or executive briefing | Log + push to **development queue** + notify user | Major court ruling, regulatory enforcement action, M&A announcement affecting client interests, legislative passage |

### Tier Classification Rules

1. **Default to Routine.** Most updates are routine. Over-classification dilutes the signal.
2. **Notable requires strategic relevance.** Ask: "Would a practitioner want to know about this at their next update?" If yes → Notable.
3. **Breaking requires urgency.** Ask: "Would a practitioner want to know about this TODAY?" If yes → Breaking.
4. **When uncertain between tiers, choose the lower tier.** False positives (over-classifying) are worse than false negatives — they train the user to ignore the queue.
5. **Context matters.** The same event might be Routine for one KB and Breaking for another. A patent filing is Routine for the filer's company KB but potentially Notable for a competitor's KB.

## SECTION 4: DEVELOPMENT QUEUE

### Purpose

The development queue aggregates Breaking-tier items across all KBs into a single, actionable list. This is the Refresh Orchestrator's interface to downstream workflows (memo drafting, client alerts, executive briefings).

### Queue Location

`C:\Users\davidrud\OneDrive - Microsoft\AI Projects\KB Creation Framework\development_queue.md`

This is a framework-level file, not per-KB. It aggregates across the entire portfolio.

### Queue Format

```markdown
# Development Queue
# Last updated: [timestamp]
# Items pending action: [N]

---

## [Priority 1] [Date] — [KB Name]
**Development:** [One-line summary]
**Details:** [From development log entry]
**Source:** [URL]
**Suggested action:** [memo / client alert / briefing note / strategy update]
**Status:** [NEW / acknowledged / actioned / dismissed]

---

## [Priority 2] [Date] — [KB Name]
...
```

### Queue Management Rules

1. **New items enter at status NEW.** The Refresh Orchestrator never auto-actions them.
2. **Human reviews and sets status:**
   - `acknowledged` — seen, will act on it
   - `actioned` — memo/alert drafted, sent, or filed
   - `dismissed` — reviewed, decided not to act
3. **Items older than 30 days at status NEW get flagged** as potentially stale themselves.
4. **The queue is NOT a to-do list.** It's a decision surface. The human decides what to do.

### Relationship to Downstream Workflows

```
Development Queue (this framework)
       │
       ▼
Human Decision: "This needs a memo"
       │
       ▼
Virtual David / Email Drafter (separate system)
  reads KB as reference → drafts memo
       │
       ▼
Fact-Checker Mode 4 (this framework)
  verifies memo independently
       │
       ▼
Human sends memo
```

The Refresh Orchestrator surfaces the item. The Builder never touches the memo. The Fact-Checker verifies the memo. Clean separation.

---

## SECTION 5: CROSS-KB REFRESH PATTERNS

### Cascade Updates

Some developments affect multiple KBs. The Refresh Orchestrator handles this:

1. **Identify cascade scope.** A Supreme Court SEP ruling affects: IP/Patents KB, SEPs KB, every company KB with a SEP portfolio.
2. **Refresh the topic KB first.** It sets the authoritative analysis.
3. **Then refresh affected company KBs** with cross-references to the topic KB.
4. **Single development log entry per KB** — even if the same event triggers multiple updates.

### Portfolio-Wide Staleness Report

Periodically (quarterly recommended), produce a portfolio-wide report:

```markdown
# Portfolio Staleness Report — [Date]

## KBs by Freshness
| KB | Last Refresh | Days Since | Status |
|----|-------------|------------|--------|
| [name] | [date] | [N] | [Fresh/Due/Overdue] |

## Overdue KBs
[List of KBs past their refresh interval]

## Top Development Log Entries (Last Quarter)
[Top 10 Notable + all Breaking items from the quarter]

## Recommended Actions
[Which KBs to prioritize, which can wait]
```

---

## SECTION 6: CONFIGURATION

### Defaults (Override Per KB)

```yaml
refresh_interval_days:
  legal_topic: 30
  company: 60
  litigation: 14
  person: 90

staleness_thresholds:
  financial_data_quarters: 1
  litigation_status_days: 14
  regulatory_status_days: 30
  leadership_days: 90

development_log:
  default_tier: routine
  breaking_notification: true
  queue_stale_days: 30

verification:
  mode: refresh  # Fact-Checker Mode 3
  verify_changed_only: true
```

### Per-KB Overrides

Store in `sources/refresh_config.md` within each KB:

```markdown
# Refresh Configuration — [KB Name]
refresh_interval_days: 14    # Active litigation, check biweekly
event_triggers:
  - docket_activity
  - judicial_opinion
  - settlement_announcement
priority: high                # Check this KB first in batch refreshes
```

---

## SECTION 7: ANTI-PATTERNS

### Don't refresh and ship without verification
Every refresh cycle must include Fact-Checker verification of changed content. Refreshing introduces errors at the same rate as deepening (~12-16% without verification).

### Don't classify everything as Breaking
If more than 10% of development log entries in a quarter are Breaking, the threshold is too low. Recalibrate. The queue becomes noise.

### Don't rewrite stable content
The Refresh Orchestrator updates stale content and adds new developments. It does not rewrite sections that are accurate and current. Unnecessary rewrites introduce errors and destroy provenance.

### Don't cascade blindly
Not every development in a topic KB requires updates to all related company KBs. Cascade updates only when the development materially changes the company-specific analysis.

### Don't skip the staleness scan
Jumping straight to web search without first identifying what's stale wastes resources on content that's already current. The staleness scan focuses effort.

*This module maintains KBs after build. It detects staleness, applies updates, verifies changes, and — critically — surfaces breaking developments for human action. It does not draft memos. It does not build KBs from scratch. It keeps the portfolio current and actionable.*
